# CDRN-channel-estimation-IRS
An implementation of our paper [Deep Residual Network Empowered Channel Estimation for IRS-Assisted Multi-User Communication Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.00241) (accepted by IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., doi: 10.1109/TWC.2021.3100148).

For more information, you can visit the [Home Page](https://cliuwcom.weebly.com/) of the first author.

Also, there is another similar work of us: [Deep Residual Learning-Assisted Channel Estimation in Ambient Backscatter Communications](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9222226) (published at IEEE Wireless Commun. Lett.).

# Installation
Please follow the instructions of keras.

# Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/XML124/CDRN-channel-estimation-IRS.git

1. use the two .m files to generate the training dataset and test dataset.
2. run the CDRN.py to realize the CDRN algorithm.
